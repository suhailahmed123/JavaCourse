INHERITANCE IN JAVA

- Let's learn inheritance using an real world example

There is farmer who ows 1 acre of land and he works day and night in that 1 acre and increases that land to 10 acres and then he handovers it to his son/daughter.

Next, the farmer's son/daughter won't start from scratch, he/she builds a house and expands it to more than 10 acres.

Next,  the farmer's grandson/granddaughter won't start from scratch, he/she take that all the "properties" of there parents & grandparents and expand it to large scale business.

So, Inheritance means child taking/inheriting the properties and behaviour of parents.

In technical terms we can define it as, Inheritance is a process of one class acquiring the properties and behavious of another class. OR 
Inheritance is a process of child class acquiring the properties and behavious of Parent class.

- Here "Properties" mewans i hope you have understood by the above example and "behavious" means like nose, eyes, and etc....

- Child Class:-
The class that extends the feature of another class is known as child class, sub class or derived class.

- Parent Class:- The class whose properties and functionalities are used (inherited) by another class is known as parent class, super class or Base class.

The properties and behavious are inherited by using "extends" keyword.


- Advantages:-
1. Code Reusability
2. Reduce development time and effort
3. Increse profitability


- Rules of Inheritance:-
1. In java private members of a class do not participate in inheritance
2. Java supports multi-level inheritance
3. Multiple inheritance is not allowed in java
4. cyclic inheritance is not allowed/supported in java
