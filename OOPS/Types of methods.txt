Types Of Methods:-

1. Inherited methods 
2. Overridden methods 
3. Specialised methods

Inherited Methods are such methods which are inherited from parent class and used without any modification in child class.

Overridden methods are such methods which are inherited from parent class and are modified and used in child class.

Specialised methods are such methods which are only present in child class but not in parent class.


Now let us consider a scenario to understand types of methods:

A parent has height, Skin-color, Hair-colour and nose

Now the child has same height and colour are inherited from the parent and used without modification, hence they are inherited methods.

Hair-colour is inherited and modified by the child and the changes the colour of hair to green, hence it is now an overridden method. 
Similarly, nose is modified and used by the child and hence it is also an overridden method.

Swim and Guitar are not present in parent class but in child class, hence they are specialised methods.
