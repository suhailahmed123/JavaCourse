- James Gosling told that he has given separate setters
1. It doesn't have return type
2. setters will have same name as class name and this is called as constructor

So we can write the definition of a constructor as, 
- The constructor is such a method who doesn't have any return type and has same name as of class name.

how to create a constructor?
- The constructor can be created in the same way as object is created
- Ex:- 
  Client c = new Client();
	Human h = new Human();
 	Car c = new Car();

Advantage:-
1. constructors will have same name as class name
2. constructor will not have any return type
3. constructor will get called during/when object is created

There are two types of constructors
1. Zero parameterized constructor or non-parameterized constructor
2. Parameterized constructor


- IMP
* if there is a parameterized constructor present then we have to explicitly write/create non-parameterized constructor

* if there is no zero parameter constructor then there is no use of creating object of that call as it can throws error by saying [The constructor Client() is undefined]
		Client c1 = new Client(); // Throws error [The constructor Client() is undefined] or constructor not found

Let's learn the difference between this keyword and this() method

- this keyword:-

1. it is a reference.
2. used to resolve shadowing problem.
3. can be any line in a constructor.
4. it can be inside method or constructor.

- this() method:-

1. it is method.
2. used to achieve local chaining.
3. it must be in the first line of constructor.
4. it cannot be inside methods, only inside constructors.

There are ttwo types of chaining in java
1. Local Chaining
2. Constructor Chaining

Local Chaining - One constructor calling another constructor inside a same class is called loacal chaining or constructor chaining.
we use this() method to achieve local chaining

- IMP
this() is a function call which is used to take control from one contructor to another contructor within the same class. 


Constructor Chaining - It the process of taking the control from child class constructor to parent class constructor.
we use super() method to achieve constructor chaining

- The parent class which is the main parent[top most] of any class is Object.

class Object
{
	Object()	
	{
		// nothing inside this constructor
	}
}

Ex:- 

class Car extends Object{


}

class Ferrari extends Car{


}
