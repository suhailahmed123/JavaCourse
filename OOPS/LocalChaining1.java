/*

There are ttwo types of chaining in java
1. Local Chaining
2. Constructor Chaining

Local Chaining - One constructor calling another constructor inside a same class is called loacal chaining or constructor chaining.
we use this() method to achieve local chaining

- IMP
this() is a function call which is used to take control from one contructor to another contructor within the same class.

/*  CODE EXPLAININATION

- The control starts from main() and enters into the main() and the first line of main() method is object creation using "new" keyword [new Dog()].

- so now the Dog() is a class or call to that class and when the control goes to that class it encounters instance variables name and breed of type String.

- And in the heap segment it assigns default values to it[ for int=0, float=0.0, string=null].

- After assigining the values there is a call to a parameterized constructor then the control goes to parameterized constructor.

- Here it encounters a this() method which is call to another constructor of same class so the control go to zero-parameterized constructor and there it replaces
  the default values with name, breed [snoopy and beagle].

- Next the control comes back to the same point [parameterized constructor] and there are no lines to executes and it gets back to main() method
- left side [Dog d] there is a reference 'd' and in stack memory the address of heap memory segment is stored and it starts points to heap.

- and next there is display or print() then by using c.getName() and c.getBreed() it displays the output and the execution completes.



OUTPUT:-
Snoopy
Beagle
