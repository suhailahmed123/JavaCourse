I hope you have got a question that what happeneed to the values of parameterized constructor?
- Let us understand here in this program

/*                                                    CODE EXPLAININATION

- The control starts from main() and enters into the main() and the first line of main() method is object creation using "new" keyword [new Dog()].

- so now the Dog() is a class or call to that class and when the control goes to that class it encounters instance variables name and breed of type String.

- And then in the heap segment it assigns default values to it[for int=0, float=0.0, string=null].

- After assigining the values there is a call to a parameterized constructor then the control comes back and then there is a call to parameterized constructor
  and the control goes to parameterized constructor.

- Here first line of the parameterized constructor is this(), so this() method which is call to another constructor of same class so the control go to 
  zero-parameterized constructor and there it replaces the default values with name, breed [snoopy and beagle].

- Next the control comes back to the same point [parameterized constructor] and there are there are two parameters [Remo, BullDog] so now those zero-parameterized 
  constructor values gets replaced by [Remo, BullDog] and after assigning the values in heap segment then the control goes back to main() method.
  
- on the left side [Dog d] there is a reference 'd' and in stack memory the address of heap memory segment is stored and it starts points to heap.

- and next there is display or print() then by using c.getName() and c.getBreed() it displays the output and the execution completes.




OUTPUT:-
Remo
BullDog
